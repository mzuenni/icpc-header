# rng.h
A pseudeo random number generator (PRNG) that can be used as a drop in replacement for the Mersenne-Twister provided with C++11.
This header implements the [xorshiro256ss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift#xoshiro256**) generator developed by George Marsaglia.

> Note: this PRNG is not cryptografically secure!

## class Xoshiro256ss
#### Types
**`result_type = std::uint64_t`**  

#### Methods
**`constexpr static std::uint64_t min()`**  
The smallest value that can be generated by the CSPRNG. This will always return 0.

**`constexpr static std::uint64_t max()`**  
The largest value that can be generated by the CSPRNG. This will always return 2<sup>64</sup>-1.

**`Xoshiro256ss(std::array<std::uint64_t, 4> seed)`**  
**`Xoshiro256ss(std::uint64_t seed)`**  
The constructor.
In the first case the `seed` will be used as initial state.
In the second case the initial state will be derived from the `seed` and some digits of pi.
> Note: the initial state (in the first case) should not be all zeros.

**`std::uint64_t operator()()`**  
Generates a single integer in [0,2<sup>64</sup>).

**`void jump()`**  
Advances the generator in the same way as 2<sup>128</sup> calls to `operator()`.
